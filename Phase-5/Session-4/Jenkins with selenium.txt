1.downaload jenkins.war file from:
	link: https://www.jenkins.io/download

	(don't choose windows installer)

2. once it is downloaded move it to 
	C:/ProgramFiles

3. open cmd and move to the roort directory of jenkins.war file 
   for me it is C:/Programfiles
cd ..
cd ..
cd ProgramFiles

4. check the java version of your system
	as jenkins supports java 8 or 11 only
	if your machine has any of the above version not to worry
	else you donwload the older version and give a path like below
.\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin\java -jar jenkins.war

5. ONCE JENKINS WILL INSTALL IT WILL GIVE YOU SECREAT CODE
	COPY THAT SECREAT CODE AND GOTO>
	localhost:8080
	paste it for initail admin password
	click> next

6. select install suggested plugins
7. add personal details and registration
